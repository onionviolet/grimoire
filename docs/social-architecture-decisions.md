# Grimoire Social: Architecture Decision Records

> **Status:** Living. Describes shipped behavior or a stable contract. Reviewed 2026-07-29.

A log of the load-bearing decisions made while planning Grimoire Social. Each entry is short by design: the *why* matters, not the prose. Companion to `social-architecture.md`.

**Format:** Status / Context / Decision / Consequences / Alternatives considered. Each ADR is self-contained; later ADRs may supersede earlier ones, never edit them in place.

## ADR-001: Steam OpenID as the sole identity provider

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Publishing and voting need a stable per-user identity. Grimoire's audience is Deadlock players, who all have Steam accounts. We need something that's free, sticky (hard to throwaway), and gives us a unique ID with minimal integration cost.

**Decision.** Use Steam OpenID 2.0 as the only login method in v1. No Discord, no email, no anonymous device IDs.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Free, no new account for the user, ties social identity to in-game identity (good for reputation and bans)
- (+) Hand-rolled OpenID verification on Workers is ~80 lines; one POST back to Steam
- (-) Locks out players who don't want to associate Steam with publishing
- (-) Single point of failure if Steam ever drops OpenID 2.0 (deprecated by Google et al., still alive at Steam)
- (-) Requires a Steam Web API key (free, tied to a domain)

**Alternatives considered.** Discord OAuth (extra account, broader reach but less sticky). Anonymous device IDs (vote stuffing trivial). Email magic links (needs paid email service, adds account-creation friction).

**Mitigations.** Wrap auth behind an `IdentityProvider` interface from day one so Discord can be added later without rewriting handlers.

## ADR-002: Like-only voting in v1

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Voting models range from single-like (Steam Workshop) to up/down (Reddit) to star ratings. Each invites different abuse patterns and moderation costs. We're a solo-dev shop with no comment system to soak engagement.

**Decision.** Single upvote ("like") per user per profile. No downvote, no rating.

**Consequences.**
- (+) No brigading drama; nothing to "review-bomb"
- (+) Simple aggregation; trivially understood by users
- (+) Easy to add downvotes later if needed; impossible to remove them once shipped
- (-) Less expressive; can't surface "popular but controversial"
- (-) Top-sort skews toward older content with accumulated likes (mitigated with `created_at` tiebreak in the index)

**Alternatives considered.** Up/down voting (brigading risk especially with NSFW content). 1-5 stars (hard to aggregate fairly with low vote counts; cognitive overhead).

## ADR-003: Cloudflare Workers + D1 + KV as the backend stack

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Need a backend that costs $0 at small scale, scales without operator intervention, has minimal ops burden for a solo dev, and runs globally for a desktop app with users everywhere.

**Decision.** Cloudflare Workers (HTTP), D1 (SQLite for relational data), KV (sessions + ephemeral state), Durable Objects (per-user rate windows). Hono as the HTTP framework.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Free tier covers expected v1 load (~10K MAU) with 10-100x headroom on most resources
- (+) Global edge presence; low latency from a desktop app's perspective
- (+) No server to babysit; deploys via `wrangler`
- (+) D1 is just SQLite: schema is portable; export with `wrangler d1 export`
- (-) Ties us to Cloudflare; vendor lock-in is real (mitigated by SQLite portability)
- (-) D1 free tier hard-stops at 100K writes/day (see ADR-013)
- (-) Workers runtime restricts Node-only libraries (see ADR-010 for OpenID consequence)

**Alternatives considered.** Supabase (built-in auth, free tier limits bite sooner; Steam auth needs custom OAuth glue anyway). Fly.io / Railway VPS ($5/mo, more ops). Self-hosted (rejected, too much overhead).

## ADR-004: Durable Object for publish-window rate limiting

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Verified via:** Cloudflare Workers docs (context7), `developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/rate-limit`

**Context.** We want "1 publish per 10 minutes per Steam ID" to stop drive-by spam. Cloudflare ships a first-party Rate Limiting API binding, but documentation explicitly states *"The `period` must be either 10 or 60 seconds."* That can't express a 10-minute window.

**Decision.** Use the RL API binding for high-frequency limits where 10s/60s windows fit (likes, auth begin). For arbitrary windows (publish 1/10min, reports 5/day), use a Durable Object per Steam ID storing a `last_action_ts` map.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Strongly-consistent across colos: no race between two POPs
- (+) Per-key isolation; one user's hot path can't starve others
- (-) DO has its own pricing dimension once we go to Workers Paid
- (-) Slightly more code than a single binding call

**Alternatives considered.** All-KV (rejected: ~60s eventual consistency lets a user race two publishes through different colos). Multiple RL bindings stacked (e.g. limit=1/period=60 fired ten times: gameable, doesn't actually enforce a 10-min window). Cloudflare WAF rate limiting (operates at the wrong layer for per-Steam-ID).

## ADR-005: API prefixed with `/v1/`, additive-only forever

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** The Electron client ships in releases. Old clients persist in the wild for years: auto-update is not always taken, and some users are on offline machines. A breaking API change would brick installed apps until the user updates.

**Decision.** All routes prefixed with `/v1/`. Once shipped, v1 is frozen: only additive changes (new optional request fields, new response fields, new endpoints). Breaking changes go to `/v2/` deployed alongside.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Installed clients never break from a server-side change
- (+) Forces backward-compatible thinking at design time
- (-) Schema cruft accumulates over time; v1 will grow ugly
- (-) When v2 ships, we maintain two surfaces until v1 usage drops to ~zero (which may be never)

**Alternatives considered.** Header-based versioning (less obvious, harder to debug). No versioning + force-update (rejected: would brick offline users and undermines the offline-first promise).

## ADR-006: Inline gzipped profile blob in D1, not R2

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Published profiles are portable profile JSON, ~3.5 KB raw, ~1 KB gzipped. We need to store and serve them. Cloudflare R2 is free for our scale and has no egress fees, but adds a round-trip per detail view.

**Decision.** Store the gzipped portable profile as a `BLOB` column in `published_profiles`. No R2 in v1.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Single round-trip for profile detail (one D1 SELECT)
- (+) Atomic with the metadata row; no consistency dance between two stores
- (+) Total storage at 10K profiles ~10 MB, well under D1's 5 GB free tier
- (-) Migrating to R2 later (e.g. if we add user-uploaded preview images) requires a copy
- (-) Each row is ~1 KB heavier; row-count storage limits hit slightly sooner

**Alternatives considered.** R2 + metadata in D1 (rejected: extra latency + consistency complexity for no benefit at 1 KB blobs). Hybrid (small inline, large in R2) (rejected: premature; profiles are bounded ~256 KB by validation cap).

**Revisit when.** We add user-uploaded preview images, or median profile size exceeds ~10 KB.

## ADR-007: Strict free-tier budget for v1

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Grimoire is a personal project with a small Deadlock-modder audience. There's no funding model. Recurring infrastructure cost is a non-starter for v1.

**Decision.** All v1 infrastructure runs on Cloudflare's free tier. Total recurring cost: $0/year + ~$12/year if we buy a domain.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Project is sustainable indefinitely without revenue pressure
- (+) Forces architectural discipline (writes are scarce, so we denormalize and cache)
- (-) Hard cliff if we exceed free limits (see ADR-013)
- (-) Some features can't be built (e.g. always-on background workers cost real money)

**Alternatives considered.** $5-50/mo budget tier (rejected per user explicit choice; can be reconsidered if usage grows).

**Upgrade trigger.** Sustained 70% of any free-tier resource for a week.

## ADR-008: Skip Phase 0 (curated GitHub-only); ship full backend directly

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** A staged path was considered: Phase 0 = static curated profiles in a GitHub repo (zero backend, validates demand), then Phase 1 = full backend if demand exists. Tradeoff is upfront effort vs. risk of building unwanted features.

**Decision.** Skip Phase 0. Build Phase 1 directly.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Faster to product-market fit; one ship instead of two
- (+) Don't have to throw away the Phase 0 curation UX
- (-) ~3-4 weeks of backend work before any user feedback
- (-) Risk that the social loop doesn't resonate and the work was wasted

**Alternatives considered.** Phase 0 first (recommended originally; user explicitly rejected: wants to build the full thing).

**Mitigation.** Pre-seed Discover with featured profiles before launch (see ADR-012) so the empty-state risk is contained even without the Phase 0 warmup.

---

## ADR-009: No comments in v1

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Comments are a primary engagement loop on social platforms: but they are also the dominant moderation cost driver. We are one developer.

**Decision.** No comment system in v1. Reactions are limited to the like button. Communication happens out-of-band (Discord).

**Consequences.**
- (+) Moderation surface stays small (titles + descriptions + reports)
- (+) No threading data model to maintain
- (-) Loses the conversational engagement loop; profiles feel inert
- (-) Authors can't get feedback on what to improve

**Alternatives considered.** Comments at launch (rejected: triples moderation cost). Disqus / external embed (rejected: privacy regression and ugly UX).

**Revisit when.** Phase 2, after the publish/like loop is proven and there's enough volume to justify the moderation investment.

## ADR-010: Hand-rolled Steam OpenID 2.0 verification on Workers

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Verified via:** context7 returned no Workers-compatible Steam OpenID library

**Context.** Steam still uses OpenID 2.0, which Node libraries (`passport-steam`, `steam-signin`) handle but require Node built-ins (`http`, `crypto`) that don't exist in the Workers runtime.

**Decision.** Implement OpenID 2.0 verification manually using `fetch`. ~80 lines: redirect to Steam's `checkid_setup`, receive callback, POST the params back with `openid.mode=check_authentication`, parse `is_valid:true`, extract SteamID64 from `openid.claimed_id`.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Zero dependencies; fits the Workers runtime perfectly
- (+) Full control over error handling and logging
- (-) Hand-rolled crypto-adjacent code is a maintenance burden
- (-) If Steam changes their OpenID flow we own the fix
- (-) Need our own test coverage; no library validation to lean on

**Alternatives considered.** Using a library (rejected: none compatible with Workers). Running a separate Node process just for auth (rejected: defeats the all-Workers architecture).

---

## ADR-011: Async safeStorage on the client; refuse to persist on Linux without a secret store

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Verified via:** Electron `docs/api/safe-storage.md` (context7)

**Context.** The session token must be stored on the client between launches. Electron's `safeStorage` provides OS-keychain-backed encryption. On Linux, if no secret store (`kwallet`, `gnome-libsecret`, Portal Secret D-Bus) is available, Electron falls back to a *hardcoded plaintext password*: effectively no encryption.

**Decision.** Use Electron's async safeStorage API (`isAsyncEncryptionAvailable`, async encrypt/decrypt). On Linux, if no real secret store is available, refuse to persist the token; the user re-logs each launch.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Async API supports Portal Secret D-Bus on Linux Flatpak/Snap (the sync API does not)
- (+) Non-blocking; supports key rotation
- (+) No false sense of security on Linux without libsecret
- (-) Some Linux users will be annoyed by re-login (mitigated by clear in-app messaging explaining why)

**Alternatives considered.** Persist anyway with a warning toast (rejected: security regression; users won't read the toast). Use sync API (rejected: doesn't support Portal Secret on sandboxed installs).

---

## ADR-012: Pre-seed featured profiles before launch

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Cold-start social products die in the empty-feed problem. Day one, Discover has zero profiles, the first-time user sees nothing, leaves, never returns. Without the Phase 0 curation runway (rejected in ADR-008), we need an alternative.

**Decision.** Hand-build 10-20 featured profiles before public launch. `published_profiles.is_featured` flag surfaces them in a "Featured" rail at the top of Discover, regardless of like count.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Discover is never empty; first-time UX has something to look at and import
- (+) Featured profiles model the kind of content we want to encourage
- (+) Admin CLI's `feature-profile` / `unfeature-profile` lets us highlight community gems later
- (-) ~half a day of manual profile curation work pre-launch
- (-) Risk of taste mismatch: our featured profiles may not match what the community wants

**Alternatives considered.** Empty Discover at launch with strong CTA (rejected: empty-state risk too high). Phase 0 curation first (rejected per ADR-008). Aggregating GameBanana collection authors automatically (interesting but Phase 2: we don't own those profiles).

---

## ADR-013: D1 free-tier hard-cliff is a real risk; alert at 70% usage

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Verified via:** Cloudflare D1 pricing FAQ (context7)

**Context.** Cloudflare docs state plainly: *"Exceeding daily read/write limits on the Free plan will prevent D1 queries from running, returning errors to your client."* This is not throttling: it's a hard error wall until the daily counter resets.

**Decision.** Acknowledge this as a high-impact risk. Build the system to alert at 70K writes/day (70% of the 100K free-tier ceiling) and pre-emptively upgrade to Workers Paid before any high-traffic share (Discord launch post, Reddit thread, etc.). Show "service is busy, try again later" toast on 5xx publish/like: never a generic error.

**Consequences.**
- (+) We don't get caught by surprise; the upgrade path is clear and cheap ($5/mo)
- (+) Graceful client-side messaging preserves user trust during outages
- (-) Manual monitoring discipline required (no built-in alerts on free tier; use a daily admin script)
- (-) Viral moment without pre-emptive upgrade = several hours of broken publish

**Alternatives considered.** Stay on free tier indefinitely (rejected: this risk eventually materializes). Pre-emptively start on Workers Paid (rejected per ADR-007 budget constraint).

## ADR-014: Account deletion = hard-delete user, soft-delete published profiles

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Users must be able to delete their account (basic privacy hygiene; GDPR-aligned even if not strictly required for our scale). But their published profiles may already be in other users' libraries, and deleting them outright would break those imports' provenance.

**Decision.** `DELETE /v1/me` hard-deletes the `users` row and all the user's `likes`, soft-deletes their `published_profiles` (sets `deleted_at`), invalidates all their sessions. The profiles become invisible in listings but the underlying rows remain so that owner-references stay referentially intact.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Identity is genuinely gone; re-login creates a fresh user
- (+) Other users' import history doesn't reference orphaned IDs
- (+) Like counts re-derive correctly via cascade (their likes are removed)
- (-) Asymmetric deletion semantics is non-obvious; needs documenting in the privacy policy
- (-) Soft-deleted profiles still occupy storage (negligible at our scale)

**Alternatives considered.** Hard-delete everything (cleaner but breaks references and history). Anonymize (`voter_steam_id = '__deleted__'`) (preserves counts perfectly but clutters the data model and is less GDPR-clean). Hard-delete profiles too (would orphan IDs in users' import history, confusing for them).

## ADR-015: Shared types via Zod schemas package

**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Two TypeScript codebases (Electron client, Workers server) sharing a wire format will silently drift. We've seen this pattern fail before at every shop.

**Decision.** Wire-format types live in a single source: a `@grimoire/social-types` package. Worker validates inbound bodies with Zod schemas exported from that package; client imports the same Zod schemas for IPC payload typing and runtime validation of responses.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Schema drift is impossible: both sides import the same definitions
- (+) Runtime validation catches malformed responses (Worker bug, transit corruption)
- (+) Generated TS types via `z.infer<>` flow naturally to both sides
- (-) Adds a publish step (or path-based dependency) to the dev loop
- (-) Schema changes require coordinated version bumps in both repos

**Alternatives considered.** Copy-paste with a header comment + CI diff check (rejected: invites drift). OpenAPI codegen (rejected: heavyweight for our scope). No shared types, document the wire format in markdown (rejected: docs rot).

---

## ADR-016: Owner-only PATCH for title + description on published profiles

**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Status:** Accepted

**Context.** Owners need to fix typos and tighten descriptions on profiles they've already published. Without an update endpoint the only workaround is unpublish + republish, which (a) burns the per-user publish window (ADR-004), (b) generates a new profile id so anyone who imported the old one loses provenance, and (c) resets the like count. None of those are appropriate for a copy edit.

**Decision.** Add `PATCH /v1/profiles/:id` (owner-only, `requireAuth`) that updates `title` and `description` and returns the full `ProfileDetail`. Both fields are optional individually; at least one must be present. The endpoint does NOT touch the share blob or any derived fields (`mod_count`, `has_nsfw`, `primary_hero`, `heroes`, `thumbnail_urls`): mutating the mod set still goes through unpublish + republish, because those derived fields anchor the integrity of the like count and the moderation surface. The PATCH is not gated by the publish DO; it's a cheap text edit, not a publish.

**Consequences.**
- (+) Owners can copy-edit without losing likes, id, or burning the publish gate
- (+) Wire-format change is purely additive (new endpoint + new request schema): ADR-005 compliant
- (+) `viewer_has_liked` returns `null` on PATCH responses because the action is owner-only and the client already knows its own like state; this avoids a second query
- (-) Adds a small write path that bypasses the DO rate limit; abuse risk is bounded by the Cloudflare Rate Limit API global throttles and the fact that only the owner can call it
- (-) Editable text means cached card previews in other clients can drift until next list/detail fetch; acceptable since lists already refetch on every Discover open

**Alternatives considered.** Rebuild the publish path to accept an existing `id` (rejected: conflates create and update, and the DO gate makes copy edits prohibitively expensive). Allow editing the share blob too (rejected: derived fields and like-count integrity make this a separate, larger decision; defer until we have a real use case beyond text fixes). Skip and tell users to unpublish/republish (rejected: ruined the "your profile" tab UX in Discover).
