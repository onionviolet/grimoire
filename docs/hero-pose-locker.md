# Live 3D hero poses in the Locker

> **Status:** Living. Describes shipped behavior or a stable contract. Reviewed 2026-07-29.

The per-hero Locker view (`src/pages/LockerHero.tsx`) shows a 2D portrait by
default and a 2D/3D toggle (top-right of the portrait panel, lg+ only). Flipping
to 3D renders a live, orbitable still of the hero in their menu pose, reflecting
the currently-enabled skin (vanilla if none is enabled).

## Why `--pose` (not an animated, skinned viewer)

`vpkmerge model export --pose [CLIP[@FRAME]]` bakes one animation frame into the
mesh and emits a *static* `.glb`:

- No skeleton, skin, or clips (`skins=0`, `animations=0`). It loads as plain
  meshes, so there is no `SkinnedMesh` and no skin-strip hack (contrast the
  soul-container path, which strips a degenerate skin; see
  `electron/main/services/soulContainerModels.ts`).
- Deadlock's NPR shells are dropped on export (they render as a white halo when
  loaded as plain glTF): the `*_outline` inverted hull, the additive `*_glow`,
  and the comic-style inked outline (`*jitter*`, e.g. Billy's
  `punkgoat_border_jitter01` on parts `*_head_jitter01`). Detection is by
  material/mesh-part name; it never inspects texture-param names, so the
  `g_tJitterMask` input on normal materials is unaffected (vpkmerge v0.6.1).
- For a skin, the menu-pose clip is mapped from `--base` (the base pak) onto the
  skin rig by bone name (skins ship 0 clips), so a skin VPK still poses.
- `--require-pose` (vpkmerge v0.6.1): a clipless WIP hero would only bake a
  static bind/T-pose, so the export errors instead and the Locker falls back to
  the 2D portrait rather than showing an unposed model. See coverage below.
- Sub-second per hero.

Net: the renderer reuses the same minimal three.js path as the soul-container
viewer (no bundled `hornet_idle.glb`, no cross-hero clip retarget).

## Pieces

Main process:
- `electron/main/services/heroPoseModels.ts`: runs the pose export, registers
  the `grimoire-hero:` privileged scheme, exposes `getHeroPoseInfo` /
  `exportHeroPose`. Keyed per `(hero, active-skin metaKey | vanilla)` so each
  skin caches its own still. Resolves a skin VPK by metaKey across base addons,
  overflow `addonsN/`, and the `.disabled` parking lot. Concurrent identical
  exports collapse onto one vpkmerge run.
- `electron/main/index.ts`: declares `HERO_POSE_SCHEME` privileged before
  app-ready and calls `registerHeroPoseProtocol()`.
- `electron/main/ipc/portraits.ts`: `get-hero-pose-info`, `export-hero-pose`.

Bridge + types:
- `electron/preload/index.ts`, `src/lib/api.ts`, `src/types/electron.d.ts`,
  `src/types/portrait.ts` (`HeroPoseInfo { hasModel, mtimeMs, key }`).

Renderer:
- `src/components/locker/HeroPoseViewer.tsx`: lazy three.js / @react-three/fiber
  viewer. Auto-exports on mount, normalizes/centers via bounding box, slow
  turntable, OrbitControls (drag to orbit, scroll to zoom), disposes the scene
  on unmount. Remounted via a `hero+skin` `key`.
- `src/pages/LockerHero.tsx`: `view3d` state, active-skin metaKey resolution,
  the toggle button, lazy-loaded `HeroPoseViewer`.

## Requires vpkmerge v0.6.0 (v0.6.1 for the pose/texture/outline fixes)

`--pose` only exists from vpkmerge v0.6.0 on (commit `aa96f71`), together with
the 8-influence skinning fix that unblocks Dynamo + Apollo (`e3a73ba`). Against
the v0.5.0 binary the `--pose` flag does not exist and the feature fails at
runtime. The bundled binary is pinned in `scripts/fetch-vpkmerge.mjs`
(`VPKMERGE_VERSION` + the three sha256s).

v0.6.1 adds three fixes the Locker depends on: deterministic hero-model
discovery (the `valve_pak` directory is a `HashMap`, so a hero with two
`<codename>.vmdl_c` such as Infernus's `inferno_v4` + old `heroes_wip/inferno`
used to resolve to a random one per export, posing or T-posing at random; it now
prefers the non-`heroes_wip` dir and highest `_vN`), `--require-pose`, and the
`*jitter*` shell drop. Bump `VPKMERGE_VERSION` + the three sha256s to the v0.6.1
release to ship them.

## Model-codename coverage (verified against the installed pak, 2026-05-28)

`--hero` discovery matches the body-model FILE basename (`<basename>.vmdl_c`
under any `/heroes*` path, ignoring the `_vN` dir). All 38 GameBanana roster
heroes resolve to a model:

- 33 resolve from their panorama codename (`codenamesForHero` in
  `heroPortraits.ts`), incl. Dynamo=`dynamo`, Ivy=`tengu`, Infernus=`inferno`.
- 5 diverge and are encoded as `MODEL_CODENAME_OVERRIDES` in `heroPoseModels.ts`:

| Hero | panorama codename | model codename (override) |
|---|---|---|
| Abrams | atlas | `atlas_detective` |
| McGinnis | forge | `engineer` |
| Grey Talon | orion | `archer` |
| Mo & Krill | krill | `digger` |
| Seven | gigawatt | `gigawatt_prisoner` |

(Seven's base body model is
`heroes_staging/gigawatt_prisoner/gigawatt_prisoner.vmdl_c`; plain `gigawatt` is
only a particle-fx model. Found by inspecting an installed Seven skin VPK's
overridden entry.)

The service tries the override(s) first, then the panorama codename(s); a hero
that resolves nothing falls back to the 2D portrait in the UI.

## Hero namespace traps

Hero lookup is not one namespace. Keep the names separate when debugging pose,
shader, material, or recolor behavior:

| Namespace | Example source | McGinnis value |
|---|---|---|
| Display name | Grimoire UI, API-facing hero name | `McGinnis` |
| Panorama/class/live-materials codename | `heroPortraits.ts`, `vpkmerge model live-materials --hero` | `forge` |
| Legacy addon alias | Older community addon/card paths, `heroPortraits.ts` aliases | `engineer` |
| Current preview model entry | `MODEL_ENTRY_OVERRIDES` in `heroPoseModels.ts` | `models/heroes_wip/mcginnis/mcginnis.vmdl_c` |
| Material/recolor namespace | `heroColors.ts`, vpkmerge recolor/material recipes and paths | `mcginnis` |

McGinnis is the easy one to get wrong because Valve's old naming still leaks
into some content. For preview and material-shader debugging, use the pinned
current model entry, not `engineer`. For `vpkmerge model live-materials`, use
`--hero forge`. For VFX/material/recolor paths, expect `mcginnis` in
`models/heroes_wip/mcginnis/...` and material names.

**Six heroes resolve a model but cannot pose** (verified 2026-05-29). Their
current body model lives under `models/heroes_wip/` and bakes *zero* animation
clips into the `.vmdl_c` (the clips ship as external `clips/` files morphic does
not follow), so `--pose` can only produce a static bind/T-pose. With
`--require-pose` the export errors and the Locker shows the 2D portrait instead:

| Hero | model codename | model path |
|---|---|---|
| Apollo | fencer | `heroes_wip/fencer` |
| Billy | punkgoat | `heroes_wip/punkgoat` |
| Celeste | unicorn | `heroes_wip/unicorn` |
| Mina | vampirebat | `heroes_wip/vampirebat` |
| Paige | bookworm | `heroes_wip/bookworm` |
| Rem | familiar | `heroes_wip/familiar` |

These will start posing on their own once Valve finalizes them (moves the model
to `heroes_staging` with baked clips, as the other heroes already are) or once
morphic learns to resolve external `clips/`. No Grimoire change needed then.

## Storage and serving

Pose stills live at `userData/hero-poses/<sanitized-key>/model.glb`. The renderer
cannot read userData under `file://` + webSecurity, so they are served through
the privileged `grimoire-hero:` scheme as
`grimoire-hero://m/<encoded-key>/model.glb?v=<mtime>`. The key rides in the path
(under a fixed `m` host) because it contains characters a standard scheme's host
parser forbids (`::`, and a `/` for overflow skins). The `?v=<mtime>` cache-busts
the renderer URL after a re-export.

Each pose dir carries a `.cache-version` marker (`POSE_CACHE_VERSION` in
`heroPoseModels.ts`). `getHeroPoseInfo` reports a GLB as present only when the
marker matches; on a mismatch (or a pre-versioning GLB with no marker) the pose
is treated as absent and regenerated in place. Bump the constant whenever the
export pipeline changes in a way that invalidates cached GLBs (a bundled-vpkmerge
fix, a shell-drop rule change, or a Deadlock patch that reworks a hero), so stale
poses regenerate transparently instead of serving an old render. v2 covers the
v0.6.1 binary swap (deterministic discovery, `--require-pose`, `*jitter*` drop)
and the recent Mirage/Mina-style in-place model reworks.

## Known limitations / follow-ups

These match the shipped `soulContainerModels.ts` behavior and are deliberately
left for a later pass:

- **No *automatic* cache eviction.** Each still is ~16 MB and every
  `(hero, skin)` combo caches its own, so `hero-poses/` grows with use. Users can
  reclaim it manually via Settings -> Local preview cache -> Clear (wipes
  `hero-poses`, `soul-models`, `portrait-cache`, and `locker-card-thumbs`; see
  `electron/main/services/previewCache.ts`). An automatic size/LRU cap (and/or a
  clear hook on skin changes) is still a follow-up.
- **Stale cache on in-place skin replacement.** `getHeroPoseInfo` only checks
  that the stored GLB exists; it does not compare against the source skin VPK's
  mtime. Replacing a skin while keeping the same VPK filename leaves a stale
  pose. A source-vs-cache mtime check would close it.
- **Skin that cannot be resolved re-exports each time.** When `resolveSkinVpk`
  fails, the still is stored under the vanilla key, so the next request for that
  skin key misses the cache and re-runs vpkmerge. Edge case (skin moved/deleted)
  only.
