 * keyed by the mod's metaKey. When the next mod was assigned the same pakNN_dir.vpk
 * slot, setModMetadata's merge behavior leaked the dead mod's gameBananaId,
 * categoryName, thumbnail, etc. onto the new install (issue #26). Callers
 * pass the current valid set (metaKeys) so users with pre-existing orphans
 * self-heal the next time the mods list is scanned.
 *
 * A key missing from that set is a *candidate*, never a verdict. The scan can
 * come back short for reasons that have nothing to do with the user deleting
 * anything: getAddonFolderPaths falls back to base-only when citadel/ is
 * unreadable (so every overflow-folder mod vanishes from the set at once),
 * scanFolder skips any file whose stat throws (antivirus holding one VPK), and
 * a path that stopped resolving scans as an empty tree. So confirm each
 * candidate against disk before deleting its row, and keep the row whenever the
 * file is there or we cannot tell.
