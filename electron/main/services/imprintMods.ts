 * imprint would do before they commit. Returns per-bucket counts (merged and
 * locker-managed kept separate even though the UI collapses them) plus the item
 * lists for the buckets a user needs to inspect (loaded + anomalies).
 *
 * Classification order (first match wins, so every candidate lands in exactly
 * one bucket and the six counts sum to scanMods()'s candidate count):
 *   1. locker-managed          -> auto-managed (excluded from bulk imprint).
 *   1b. merged + FRESH         -> auto-managed (merge already reflects the
 *                                 sidecar; no repack pending).
 *   2. blocked-loaded          -> the running game has it memory-mapped.
 *   3. already-imprinted       -> carries a CURRENT-format embed (modinfo.json)
 *                                 that is FRESH (refreshable fields match the
 *                                 sidecar). A legacy-only or stale embed
 *                                 classifies eligible: it IS pending work, the
 *                                 same way the bulk run treats it. A merged
 *                                 mod whose embed is stale (never migrated, or
 *                                 the source list/title drifted) ALSO lands
 *                                 here: merged is no longer a blanket auto-
 *                                 managed exclusion, only a fresh merge is.
 *   4. anomalous               -> anomaly guard flagged it (skip + report),
 *                                 including 'orphan-merge': the sidecar has no
 *                                 `merged` entry but the file's own embed/
 *                                 legacy companion positively looks like an
 *                                 unreconstructable merge (NEVER FLATTEN).
 *   5. eligible                -> safe to imprint (includes stale re-imprints,
 *                                 merged or not).
 *
 * Ordering locker before already-imprinted matches imprintAllInstalled, which
 * excludes Locker-managed artifacts from its candidate set entirely (merged
 * mods are no longer excluded there either, mirroring this). Ordering
 * blocked-loaded before already-imprinted mirrors the bulk loop (loaded is
 * checked first, so a loaded-but-already-imprinted mod reports as loaded,
 * consistent across both). The anomaly guard never re-records any canonical
 * identity (KEYSTONE).
