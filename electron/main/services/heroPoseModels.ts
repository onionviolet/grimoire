/**
 * Per-hero static "pose" model store.
 *
 * The Locker's per-hero view shows a flat 2D portrait. This service produces a
 * lightweight 3D still of the hero striking their menu pose so the Locker can
 * render the actual model (and the actual active skin) instead.
 *
 * Built with the bundled `vpkmerge model export --pose`: it bakes one animation
 * frame into the mesh and emits a *static* `.glb` (no skeleton, skin, or clips)
 * with Deadlock's inverted-hull `*_outline` and additive `*_glow` shells
 * dropped (both collapse to an opaque white halo as plain glTF). For a skin the
 * pose clip is mapped from the base pak onto the skin's own rig by bone name
 * (same hero = same rig), so a skin VPK that ships zero clips still poses.
 *
 * Keyed per (hero, active skin) so each skin caches its own still and switching
 * skins is instant once generated. A texture-only skin (or no skin) falls back
 * to the base pak's mesh while the skin's textures still win.
 *
 * Layout: userData/hero-poses/<key>/model.glb
 *
 * The renderer can't read userData files directly under file:// + webSecurity,
 * so they're served through the registered `grimoire-hero:` scheme
 * (see registerHeroPoseProtocol).

 * highest-`_vN` basename match, so for these heroes it lands on the STALE model
 * and the Locker showed the wrong body. Pin the exact current entry instead.
 *
 * An explicit `--entry` is also more correct than `--hero` once a skin is active:
 * a modern skin overrides the game's canonical path (these very paths), which a
 * codename/version mismatch in discovery could miss, silently falling back to
 * the vanilla base mesh.
 *
 * Verified against the installed pak (2026-05-29) and reconciled live in-game by
 * a community reporter (#bugs "3D Preview pulling wrong model"): each entry
 * decodes, carries a real menu pose, and is the current model. Viscous is a
 * no-op today (`--hero viscous` already resolves here) but pinned for the same
 * skin-path robustness. Rem is pinned to `familiar_wip`: the plain
 * `familiar.vmdl_c` exports a live skeleton/clip with every rendered vertex
 * weighted to pelvis, so the mixer advances while the mesh stays effectively
 * bind-posed.
 *
 * Infernus is pinned to `heroes_wip/inferno`: a modern skin (e.g. Bunnyfernus,
 * GameBanana 677760) overrides that model and its materials in place, but
 * `--hero inferno` discovery reads the model/materials from the base pak and so
 * baked the vanilla look while `live-materials` (vdata-resolved, `--vpk`-priority)
 * correctly surfaced the skin's renamed `bunfernus_clothes.vmat` + doubled-path
 * texture overrides (#bugs "3D preview shows vanilla skin"). An explicit
 * `--entry` reads the model from the skin VPK, so the override wins; verified that
 * `--entry ... --pose --require-pose` poses (the earlier "no pose clip" reason for
 * leaving Infernus on `--hero` is stale) and that the vanilla no-skin export is
 * unaffected. Deliberately NOT pinned: Billy (`punkgoat` ships the rig but no pose

 * served only when its sidecar marker matches this; on a mismatch the pose is
 * treated as absent and regenerated in place (the new GLB overwrites the old, so
 * no per-version directories pile up on disk).
 *
 * v2: bundled vpkmerge gained deterministic hero-model discovery, `--require-pose`
 * (so clipless WIP heroes fall back to the 2D portrait instead of a T-pose), and
 * the comic-outline (`*jitter*`) shell drop. Pre-v2 GLBs (unversioned) are stale.
 *
 * v3: reworked heroes (Abrams, McGinnis, Pocket, Ivy, Lady Geist, ...) now pin
 * their exact current `heroes_wip` entry instead of `--hero` discovery, which had
 * been resolving to the stale pre-rework body. Pre-v3 GLBs cached the wrong model.
 *
 * v4: Rem now pins `familiar_wip.vmdl_c`; old cached Familiar GLBs targeted
 * `familiar.vmdl_c`, whose rendered vertices are all pelvis-weighted.
 *
 * v5: glb.rs material-export fixes (roughness from the normal texture's BLUE
 * channel not its constant alpha, normal-Z reconstruction, and constant
 * metalness/roughness/color-tint fallbacks), so PBR reads correctly under the
 * new IBL. Old GLBs baked fully-rough/matte surfaces; forces a re-export.
 *
 * v6: sheen now reads TextureSheenColor1 * tint and binds the g_tSheen texture
 * (was white sheen on most cloth), and glass honors the authored g_flIOR.
 *
 * v7: vpkmerge fixed draw-call index offsets for resourcecompiler/global-index
 * meshes. Pre-v7 cached GLBs can contain out-of-range primitive indices, which
 * renders shredded in three.js even after the bundled binary is fixed.
 *
 * v8: vpkmerge static pose baking keeps Source 2 secondary-motion cloth/fabric
 * chains bind-relative instead of freezing their authored sim tracks mid-pose.
 * Pre-v8 GLBs can show detached coat tails, skirts, and cloth panels.
 *
 * v9: same static-pose fabric fix, with old dev preview caches force-expired
 * after confirming one-frame menu poses can carry unsolved cloth state.
 *
 * v10: bundled vpkmerge now resolves `--hero` against `heroes.vdata_c`
 * (m_strModelName), the authoritative live model, instead of a filename match
 * that preferred non-`heroes_wip` dirs and so returned the stale staging body.
 * Fixes every un-pinned hero (e.g. Wraith resolved to `heroes_staging/wraith`).
 * The MODEL_ENTRY_OVERRIDES pins below remain as targeted fallbacks for any hero
 * that live resolution still misses. Pre-v10 GLBs cached the outdated model.
 *
 * v11: morphic extras now embed broader Source 2 preview texture slots
 * (`g_tGlass`, `g_tAltTranslucency`, `g_tJitterMask`, etc.) instead of only the
 * NPR masks. Pre-v11 GLBs do not carry enough metadata for shader-rich previews
 * such as Viscous.
 *
 * v12: bundled vpkmerge branch build with live material resolution fixes and
 * updated morphic payloads for the unified material preview. Pre-v12 GLBs may
 * carry stale material metadata and render eye/self-illum materials incorrectly.
 *
 * v13: pose keys are now content-addressed (a fingerprint of the resolved source
 * VPKs is folded into the key; see poseKey). Pre-v13 dirs were keyed by the skin's
 * pakNN slot filename alone, so different skins reusing a slot collided and served
 * each other's cached model. Retiring those dirs forces a clean re-export.
 *
 * v14: Infernus is now pinned to an explicit `--entry` (see MODEL_ENTRY_OVERRIDES).
 * Pre-v14 Infernus GLBs were baked via `--hero inferno`, which read the base pak
 * and so cached the vanilla look over any active skin; force a re-export.
 *
 * The Source 2 extras schema version (SOURCE2_EXTRAS_VERSION) is folded into the
 * effective key below, so a material-extras schema bump auto-busts this cache
 * with no manual edit here, and the cache version cannot drift from the parser's
 * expected schema. Bump POSE_PIPELINE_VERSION only for export changes unrelated
 * to the extras schema (model resolution, index offsets, ...).
