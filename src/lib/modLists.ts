/**
 * User-authored lists for the Installed page: named buckets a mod can belong
 * to, used purely to organize and filter the library.
 *
 * Lists are deliberately a *view* concept. They never enable, disable, or
 * reorder anything: that is what Mod Profiles are for, and a list that also
 * toggled mods would be a profile with a worse name. The only thing a list
 * does is narrow which cards the Installed grid shows.
 *
 * Membership is keyed by `modPreferenceKey` (see disabledModPrefs.ts), so it
 * survives the pakNN rename that enabling/disabling performs, and a GameBanana
 * group shares a key with singletons from the same submission. The one gap is
 * that key's last-resort `mod:<id>` form, which is derived from the pakNN
 * filename and so is not rename-stable: it only applies to a mod with neither a
 * GameBanana id nor a sha256, which the metadata sidecar backfills for every
 * installed VPK. Favorites have carried the same caveat since they shipped.
 *
 * Orphans are kept, never pruned, including when a mod is deleted. A key with no
 * matching installed mod can come back: reinstalling a GameBanana mod produces
 * the same `gamebanana:<id>` key, and a temporarily unreadable game folder must
 * not silently destroy the user's organization. Pruning on delete would also be
 * wrong for groups, which share one key across every variant of a submission:
 * deleting a single variant would unfile the whole group. Counts shown in the UI
 * come from live entries only, so a stale key costs nothing but a few bytes.
 *
 * The localStorage key string is frozen: changing it orphans every list already
 * saved by a shipped build.
