 * Build the launch-time shuffle plan from the raw mod list. Filters to per-hero
 * skin mods (the same predicate the Locker uses for its hero grid), groups them
 * by hero, and shuffles every hero that has at least one opted-in skin. The
 * General classification buckets (groupGlobalMods, the same grouping the
 * Locker's General view tabs on) ride along as extra groups, so an opted-in
 * announcer pack or HUD re-rolls exactly like a hero skin. Keeping this here
 * means the Locker and the launch path share one grouping + selection path, so
 * the set of mods a launch can pick is exactly the set the Locker shows the
 * opt-in toggle on.
